          <h1>The Norm and the Exceptions</h1>

    <p>After reading through Chapter 6 of <i>The Truthful Art</i>, I decided to present the concept of the norm and the exceptions in the form of data that I have collected. Having an interest in travel and other countries, I made a list of countries in each of these four continents and researched their populations in millions. After doing so, I went through and calculated the median, range, mean poulation of each continent, mean population of all of the continents, and mean poupulation of the countries to compare the data.</p>

        <p>When doing this, I proved that, as stated in Chapter 6, that the mean is much more susceptible to change than the median is with the presence of outliers (or exceptions). The best example of this, with the data I have collected, can be seen with South America. Given the large population of 209 million people in Brazil, the mean (47.5 milllion) ended up being larger than the other five countries' populations. With that being said, the median of 17 million provided a more accurate representation (a norm) of that particular distribution, as Brazil contains 177 million more people than the next largest country on the list. </p>
  
    <p>Given this particular set of data, the ranges were able to share the population difference between the largest and smalles countries listed under each continent. However, they do not provide much insight about the countries in between the largest and smallest. With the mean population of the continents vs the mean population of the countries, the numbers were not too different. With that said, one would need to used weighted means to properly calculate the mean population of the continents because each continent has a different number of countries listed.</p>
        
    <p>With all of this being said, it is apparent that one method of measuring central tendency cannot accurately depict the distribution of data. Rather, it is pertinent to calculate more than one measure in order to get a better feel of what the data set looks like. This same idea applies to analyzing data using charts, as one visualization alone is incapable of speaking for the entire set of data.</p>
